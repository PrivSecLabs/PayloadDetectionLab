# USB Rubber Ducky Payloads

## Objective


The Penetration Test Lab project was motivated by the work of Hak5 and contributions from members of the GitHub community. This project aimed to create a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber-attacks. The main objective was to configure payloads on a Raspberry Pi Pico, deliver them through a USB interface, and evaluate their detection by Windows Defender and other AV tools. This hands-on approach was intended to enhance practical knowledge of network security, attack techniques, and defense mechanisms.

### Skills Learned


- Advanced understanding of Powershell scripts and unathourized admin access.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Endpoint detection (such as LimaCharlie and Windows Defender) for detecting the execution of payloads.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Examine memory dumps, Event Viewer logs, and Task Manager to identify and understand malicious processes.
